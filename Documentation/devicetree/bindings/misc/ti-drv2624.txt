* TI DRV2624

DRV2624 Ultra Low Power Closed-Loop LRA/ERM Haptic Driver with Internal Memory

Required properties:
- compatible: the string of "ti,drv2624"
- reg: the i2c slave address of the IC
- ti,rated_voltage: 8 bit, rated voltage register setting
- ti,overdrive_voltage: 8 bit, overdrive voltage register setting

Optional:
- ti,nrst-gpio: GPIO connected to DRV2624 NRST. If not in use NRST should be connected to Vdd
- ti,intz-gpio: GPIO connected to DRV2624 TRIG/INTZ. If not in use INTZ should be connected to ground
- ti,auto_cal: boolean, enable boot-up calibration. Disabled by default
- ti,lra_drive: boolean, when selected configures LRA actuator type, otherwise actuator type is ERM
- ti,open_loop: boolean, when selected configures open loop drive, otherwise closed loop drive
- ti,nvctrl-gpio: GPIO to indicate state for context aware vibration experience
- ti,rated_voltage_reduced: 8 bit, reduced value of rated voltage register setting
- ti,overdrive_voltage_reduced: 8 bit, reduced value of overdrive voltage register setting
- ti,sample_time: 8 bit, sample time register setting
- ti,drive_time; 8 bit, drive time register setting (applied by mask 0x1F)

Example:

drv2624@5A {
	compatible = "ti,drv2624";
	reg = <0x5A>;
	ti,rated_voltage = /bits/ 8 <0x6D>;
	ti,overdrive_voltage = /bits/ 8 <0xF0>;
	ti,lra_drive;
	ti,auto_cal;
};
